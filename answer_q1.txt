Q1:

The task of super-resolution is to take a low-res image and estimate its high-res counterpart. The workflow

to implement this use-case your self, you will need to answer the following question:
Q1: suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that
could be used for super-resolution. A full answer consists of a description of the corruption function,
and how to properly use the restore_image() function for this task. For this context only, you could
optionally add additional operations before calling to restore_image().
